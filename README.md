<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.

### Prerequisites

We need an app to manage Apache and MySQL service, in my case, I chose lampp for its simpplicity.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Weslife2002/Caro_Game_ReactJS_NodeJS_Project.git
   ```
2. Init NPM in both node_server and react_server folders.
  ```sh
   npm init
   ```
3. Install NPM packages to download all dependencies in both node_server and react_server folders.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the project in both node_server and react_server folders.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
