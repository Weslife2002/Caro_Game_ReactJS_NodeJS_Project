# Caro_Game_ReactJS_NodeJS_Project
This is the caro game in which I use ReactJS and NodeJS to build client and server. As it is the first time I use ReactJS for a project, I made a lot of mistakes in dividing the Front end part into subcomponents, as well as which component should own which states. However, I learnt a lot from that experience.
